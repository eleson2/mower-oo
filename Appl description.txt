Tis codebase is intended for smooth mower control 
where it is possible to to say:
"in 1.5 sec, Left motor shall be 
at 50% and right motor at 80%."

In that way it should be possible to
 do arbitary curves and spirals with the intent 
 to not introduce unnesseary  accelerations
 and braking on a sensitive lawn


 I don't care much for precision, 
 In reality it will not introduce any problematic jerkiness.

Explain textually on a high level how 2-4 would be implemented. 
My idea was to implement GPS and a way to smoothly follow straight lines. 
Also textually on a high level explain how that could be implemented.


No thanks to dynamic trajectory for now, circles are easy to do anyways, and spiral will be quite easy as well.
I can see the need for S-curves acceleration, but let's wait .
Trajectory queuing is ok to do in code for now. 

Let's aim for changing the straight line fiunction to follow an imaginary line
 with start and end points. Let us for now not worry about implementing GPS and how
  to generating that line , insterad assumne aa line has been genreated and now the 
  mower shall connect to the line and smoothly follow it
Assume the mower has a gyro / accelerator sensor if that helps.
ok , please implement this. Assume most common gyro/accelerator for these kind of projects. 
If needed ,create a stub interface for GPS
